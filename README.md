### MATHLIB : helper library for ReOpengl-Easy project  
---
MATHLIB is a lightweight, modular math and geometry library designed for use with the ReOpenGL-Easy project.  
It provides implementations for basic 2D and 3D geometric shapes, as well as utility functions for collision detection (soon).  
This library depends on the custom math header: "LAmath.h".

## Supported shapes until now:
->Points
->Rectangles
->Circles
->Lines
