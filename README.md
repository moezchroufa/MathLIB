MATHLIB is a lightweight, modular math and geometry library designed for use with the ReOpenGL-Easy project.  

It provides implementations for basic 2D and 3D geometric shapes, as well as utility functions for collision detection (soon).  

This library depends on the custom math header: "LAmath.h".
